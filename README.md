# Bangalore Real Estate Price Predictor

## Overview

The Bangalore Real Estate Price Predictor project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts real estate prices in Bangalore based on various features. This project involves data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **data/**

  - **raw/**: Contains the raw data files used for the project.
  - **processed/**: Contains the processed data files that are ready for analysis and modeling.
  - **external/**: May contain external datasets that are used in the project.

- **notebooks/**

  - **01-eda.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis, generating insights and visualizations.

- **src/**

  - **data/**
    - **make_dataset.py**: Functions to load and preprocess the dataset.
  - **features/**
    - **build_features.py**: Functions to create and extract features from the dataset.
  - **models/**
    - **train_model.py**: Logic for training the machine learning model, including model selection and evaluation.
  - **utils/**
    - **helpers.py**: Utility functions for data manipulation and visualization.
  - ****init**.py**: Marks the src directory as a Python package.

- **models/**: Intended to store the trained models or model artifacts.

- **tests/**

  - **test_model.py**: Unit tests for model training and evaluation functions.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

- **environment.yml**: Used for managing the project environment, specifying packages and versions needed.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, you can use either `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`.

### Using requirements.txt

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv env
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Using environment.yml

1. Create the environment using conda:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
2. Activate the environment:
   ```
   conda activate <environment_name>
   ```

## Usage

1. Start by exploring the data using the Jupyter notebook located in the `notebooks/` directory.
2. Use the `src/data/make_dataset.py` file to load and preprocess the dataset.
3. Extract features using the `src/features/build_features.py` file.
4. Train the model using the `src/models/train_model.py` file.
5. Evaluate the model performance and make predictions.

## Testing

Run the unit tests located in the `tests/test_model.py` file to ensure that the model training and evaluation functions work as expected.
